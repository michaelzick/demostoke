  'performance shortboard',
  'Mid: 20 3/4", Thick: 2 5/8", Fin: Tri Fin. Recommended for: Intermediate to Advanced level surfers. This surfboard rental is a full-size Fish design which features a broad nose and wide body template combined with a shallow entry rocker. This wide, flat combination allows it to catch the smallest of waves. It''s generous proportion handles the bigger riders than the 6''4" length implies. Surprisingly fast and loose, it makes a perfect first shortboard or addition to your quiver. Experienced grom surfers who normally ride a shortboard may find this surfboard to work well in Waikiki or a small day on the North Shore.',
