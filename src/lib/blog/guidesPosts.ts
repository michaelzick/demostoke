    title: 'How to Pop Up on a Surfboard: Step-by-Step Guide',
    excerpt: 'Master the pop-up technique with this detailed walkthrough so you can get to your feet quickly and confidently.',
    content: `The pop-up is the moment where paddling ends and surfing begins. Done correctly, it launches you from laying down to riding with balance and control.

    "Before you start to stand on the board you will need to figure out what stance your prefer. The best way to stand on a board is sideward you will need to play
    around with what stance feel more comfortable. If your “Regular” stance you will have your right foot at the back closer to the tail, and the left at the front
    closer to the center of the board and if you’re “Goofy” it will be the opposite. Both these stance are the same it’s just down to your preference ([SBS Boards](https://sbsboards.com/pop-surfboard/))."

**Preparation**

- Start with your board pointed toward the beach and paddle hard to match the wave's speed.
- Keep your eyes forward and your body centered over the board.

**Hand Placement**

- Place your palms flat on the board beside your chest, fingers spread for stability.
- Keep your elbows tucked in to maximize power.

**The Pop-Up Motion**

- Push your upper body up as though doing a quick push-up.
- In the same motion, slide or jump your feet under your body.
- Land with knees bent and your feet roughly shoulder-width apart.

**Stance and Balance**

- Keep your back knee bent and your front foot angled slightly toward the nose.
- Stay low with your weight centered to maintain control as the board accelerates.

**Common Mistakes**

- Looking down at your feet instead of ahead down the line.
- Trying to stand in stages instead of one swift movement.
- Placing your hands too far forward, causing the board to stall.

Practice the pop-up on land before heading into the water, and remember that fluidity comes with repetition. With time, you’ll move from wobbly first attempts to confident takeoffs on any wave.`,
