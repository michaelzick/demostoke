    title: "My Surfboard Evolution: From Foamie to Fish to Forever Stoke",
    excerpt: "A personal journey through the surfboards that shaped my surfing—from 12-foot foamies to nimble fish shapes—and why the stoke still runs deeper than ever.",
    content: `I'll never forget the first time I caught a wave. It was at Little Dume in Malibu, and my coworker started offering surf lessons. On a 12-foot Wavestorm, I felt like I was flying over jagged rocks decorated with kelp and barnacles that looked like artwork. I knew that if I fell there'd be hell to pay, but I didn't. Instead, I got addicted. I knew then that this would be a feeling I would chase again and again.

**Starting on the Giant Foamie**

Like most new surfers, I started with the big blue Costco special. The 12-foot Wavestorm was ridiculously buoyant, almost like cheating for wave-catching. But you know what? I loved it. It let me focus on the fundamentals: paddling with purpose, popping up cleanly, trimming down the line.  

It was humbling and goofy in equal measure. There was no pretending you were Kelly Slater on that thing—but you *could* learn how to read a wave, move with it, and respect its power.

**Buying My First Epoxy Longboard**

Eventually I felt ready for my own board. I picked up an epoxy longboard—a classic shape, light and durable (in theory). I was so damn proud of that thing.  

I still remember the day I dinged it. The surf was tiny. Like, *ankle slappers*. I got overeager trying to squeeze turns where none existed, and ran it straight into a rock near shore. I was crushed for about 10 minutes, then laughed. Because that's surfing: you're always one bad decision away from humility.

That board was perfect for learning cross-steps, nose rides, and gaining confidence in crowded lineups. It taught me patience—waiting for the right wave, timing takeoffs, accepting wipeouts without ego.

**Down to a Fish Shape**

After some time on the longboard, I wanted something looser. Enter the fish. Wide, thick, with that split tail that looked so weird and cool at the same time.  

Riding a fish felt like unlocking cheat codes. Suddenly I could glide through mushy sections, generate speed with barely a pump, and cut tighter lines on small days. It had just enough volume to forgive my mistakes, but it demanded better footwork and reading the wave face.

It was the board that made me fall in love with *playing* on a wave rather than just riding it.

**Shortboards and Grovelers**

Of course, it didn't stop there. Once the fish felt comfortable, I started looking at shortboards and grovelers.  

Shortboards punished bad technique immediately, but they also opened up new maneuvers: sharper turns, snaps under the lip, floaters. Grovelers let me surf gutless summer slop without feeling like I was paddling a door.

Each new shape forced me to refine something. Paddling efficiency. Pop-up speed. Weight distribution. Reading the lineup. Understanding when to commit and when to bail.

**Why the Stoke Never Left**

Even as I've added snowboarding to my list of main activities—chasing powder lines and carving steeps—the feeling of surfing remains unmatched. It's my most-loved activity for good reason.  

Surfing gives me mental clarity like nothing else. You can't think about your inbox, your rent, or your anxieties when you're paddling for your life or gliding down a glassy face.  

Physically, it's humbling and rewarding: cardio, strength, balance, timing. Emotionally, it's a reset button. Even the worst session reminds me that I'm part of something bigger and older than myself.

And that first wave at Little Dume? I'm still chasing it. Every board, every session, every wipeout and triumph is part of that same lifelong pursuit: feeling connected, alive, and endlessly stoked.`,
