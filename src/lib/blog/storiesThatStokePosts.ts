    title: "From Foamie To Fresh Powder: How I Became Demo-Obsessed",
    excerpt: "A personal journey from Wavestorms to wipeouts to dialed-in snowboards—and why I won't buy without trying ever again.",
    content: `If I was bitten by the surfing bug, it was by a 12-foot monster from Costco. The classic beginner special—a blue and white Wavestorm foamie. But my first session wasn't in Venice or Santa Monica. It was at Little Dume, north of Malibu, over jagged rocks so shallow that wiping out meant stitches.

Little Dume is the mellower sibling of Point Dume, with its notorious crowds and punchy swell. Thankfully for me, it was small that day.

After a few more Wavestorm sessions, I was ready for my own board. I found a cheap epoxy 9'0 online. Knowing nothing, I took it to Dockweiler and immediately dinged it. I rode a crappy little calf slapper straight into shore and slammed it onto some rocks. A garbage ding repair later, I was back in the water.

That's how it went. From an epoxy longboard to a 7'6 "funboard, I bought cheap boards that I didn't mind thrashing. The same goes for the 6'0 fish I picked up later, built with regular PU and ultra-thin glassing. The kind that cracks if you even look at it wrong.

From then on, PU was my jam. Epoxy's fine if it's done right—Firewire nails it—but I just like the feel of polyurethane more.

Over the years, the boards got shorter. I picked up some good ones—Channel Islands, for example—but I also grabbed boards way too small for how I surf or the waves I ride.

I landed some keepers like the CI Neckbeard 1.0 and the Chilli Churro. I've heard it, lived it, and now I'll say it: there's no substitute for trying before buying. Demo days are clutch, and some brands do tours or partner with shops, so you can actually test the thing before dropping cash.

Demo gear is still way too hard to find. That's part of why I started this site. I want people to feel that certainty—the board is right, not because someone sold it to you, but because you knew it under your feet.

Too many people buy gear because someone told them it would work, they read about it online, or worse—because of the name on it. I've done it plenty, which is why my own success ratio is about 50% when buying gear I didn't demo beforehand.

Now that I've started snowboarding, the same lessons apply. I chose my first board after riding it at Palisades Tahoe in spring 2024: the Capita DOA. It felt right immediately. Easy enough for my abilities but with room to grow. Not perfect for every condition—deep powder needs something else—but it's excellent for all-mountain riding.

You ride powder boards on deep days, stiff boards on ice, something else for the park. The Capita DOA is a killer for most circumstances, but not everything. Of course, I'm still new to snowboarding, and there are ways I could tweak my bindings, but having the right board for the right conditions is the way to go.

When I'm ready for my next snowboard, surfboard, mountain bike—whatever—I'll always try to demo it first.

From that first pop-up on a Wavestorm to taking waves all the way to the sand at Pipeline, the boards I've ridden have shaped my experience immensely. Choosing the right gear matters and is often the difference between a stoked session and one where you wonder where your abilities went.

When you get that gear that feels like it's made for you, the whole experience changes. That's what it means to ride what makes you feel alive.`,

    title: "Kelly Slater on Music, Surfing and the Power of Flow",
    excerpt: "Highlights from Kelly Slater's conversation with Rick Beato about how music and surfing intersect and why staying curious keeps him stoked.",
    content: `Rick Beato recently sat down with 11-time world surf champion Kelly Slater to explore how a life spent chasing waves blends with a passion for music.

Slater recalled singing for relatives as a kid and learning guitar alongside friends like Rob Machado and Jack Johnson. Despite never taking formal lessons, he said songwriting became a creative outlet much like finding the rhythm of a wave. Working with producer T-Bone Burnett in the 1990s pushed him to refine his vocal chops and approach recording the same way he approaches surfing—by trusting feel over perfection.

The two discussed how every wave has a cadence that dictates your movements, similar to how a melody suggests certain chords. Slater sees both pursuits as exercises in timing, balance and flow. He also shared stories about building artificial waves and teaching beginners, noting that understanding body mechanics is key whether you're strumming a guitar or dropping into a barrel.

Beyond technique, Slater spoke about the joy of staying curious. From experimenting with different surfboard designs to jamming with friends on stage, he believes cross-training your mind and body leads to breakthroughs. It's a philosophy that has kept him competing into his fifties and still excited to chase the next swell.

Slater ended the chat by inviting Beato to surf his wave pool—a reminder that the best stories are born from shared experiences.
