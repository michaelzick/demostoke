    title: "Never Summer Proto Type Two Review: The All-Mountain Beast That Lives Up to the Hype",
    excerpt: "After riding the Never Summer Proto Type Two for a full season, we break down why this board has become a favorite among advanced riders and what makes it stand out in the crowded all-mountain category.",
    content: `The Never Summer Proto Type Two is frequently highlighted in snowboard reviews for its high-performance all-mountain capabilities. The board features Never Summer's proprietary Rocker Camber construction, with camber underfoot and rocker at the tip and tail, creating a lively, responsive feel that excels in both carving and powder ([TheGoodRide](https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/never-summer-proto-type-two-2019-2020-review/)).

**Build Quality and Construction**

The carbon fiber VXR laminate adds snap without making the board overly stiff. The sintered base is fast and holds wax well, while the Durasurf XT topsheet is noted for its durability. At 159cm, the board offers excellent torsional stiffness without feeling heavy.

**On-Mountain Performance**

- Groomed Runs: The Proto Type Two shines on groomed terrain, with camber underfoot providing excellent edge hold, even on icy conditions. Turn initiation is quick and precise, with minimal chatter at speed.
- Powder: The rockered nose floats well in deep snow, while the setback stance and tapered tail help the board surf through powder. It's not as playful as a dedicated powder board, but for an all-mountain stick, it performs admirably.
- Park and Freestyle: While not primarily designed for park riding, the Proto Type Two is stable on jumps and rails. The medium flex provides enough pop for ollies while maintaining stability on landings.

**Pros:**

- Exceptional edge hold and carving performance
- Versatile across all terrain types
- Durable construction
- Great float in powder for an all-mountain board
- Responsive and lively feel

**Cons:**

- Higher price point than many competitors
- May be too aggressive for beginner/intermediate riders
- Limited availability (sells out quickly each season)

**Summary**

The Never Summer Proto Type Two is recommended for advanced riders seeking a board that can handle a variety of conditions. For more details, see [TheGoodRide review](https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/never-summer-proto-type-two-2019-2020-review/).

    title: "Firewire Seaside Surfboard Review: Modern Fish with Classic Flow",
    excerpt: "A detailed look at the Firewire Seaside, a modern fish surfboard designed by Rob Machado, praised for its speed, maneuverability, and versatility in a wide range of conditions.",
    content: `The Firewire Seaside, designed by Rob Machado, is widely recognized for blending the classic fish outline with modern performance features. Reviewers at Magicseaweed and Boardshop highlight its quad fin setup, wide outline, and low rocker, which together deliver impressive speed and flow in small to medium surf ([Magicseaweed](https://magicseaweed.com/news/firewire-seaside-review/11913/), [Boardshop](https://www.boardshop.co.uk/blog/firewire-seaside-surfboard-review)).

**Performance**

- Small Waves (1-3 feet): The Seaside excels in weak surf, generating speed quickly and maintaining glide through flat sections. The boardâ€™s width and volume make it easy to paddle and catch waves early.
- Medium Waves (3-5 feet): As conditions improve, the Seaside remains lively and responsive. The quad fin setup enhances maneuverability, allowing for tight turns and smooth transitions from rail to rail.
- Larger Waves (5+ feet): While not a step-up board, the Seaside can handle overhead surf for experienced riders, maintaining control and drive down the line.

**Who Should Ride It**

- Surfers seeking a fast, fun board for everyday conditions
- Fans of the classic fish feel with added modern performance
- Intermediate to advanced surfers looking for a versatile addition to their quiver

**Pros:**

- Excellent paddling and wave-catching ability
- Fast and smooth in a variety of conditions
- High-quality construction and durability
- Quad fin setup for added drive and control

**Cons:**

- Wide outline may not suit those who prefer narrow, high-performance shortboards
- Not a true groveler for the absolute smallest days

**Summary**

The Firewire Seaside is a standout for surfers who want a board that combines classic style with modern versatility.

    title: "Pyzel Gremlin Surfboard Review: Small Wave Powerhouse with Surprising Versatility",
    excerpt: "A look at why the Pyzel Gremlin is a favorite for surfers seeking fun, speed, and performance in everyday waves.",
    content: `The Pyzel Gremlin is often recommended by surf reviewers as a board that brings maximum fun to average and below-average surf. Its full outline, wide nose, and low entry rocker make it easy to paddle and catch waves early. The single to double concave bottom and wide, curvy tail help generate speed and maintain control through turns ([StabMag](https://stabmag.com/gear/pyzel-gremlin-review/)).

**Performance**

- Small Waves (1-3 feet): The Gremlin excels in small, weak surf, planing quickly and picking up speed with minimal effort. The boardâ€™s width and volume up front help surfers get into waves early, while the pulled-in tail keeps it lively and responsive.
- Medium Waves (3-5 feet): The Gremlinâ€™s versatility shines as the surf picks up. It holds a line well, feels stable at speed, and transitions smoothly from rail to rail. The board is forgiving but still offers enough performance for aggressive turns and snaps.
- Larger Waves (5+ feet): While not a step-up board, the Gremlin can handle bigger surf than expected. The extra volume helps with late drops, and the tail shape provides surprising hold in steeper sections.

**Who Should Ride It**

- Intermediate to advanced surfers seeking a daily driver for average conditions
- Surfers who want a board that paddles easily but doesnâ€™t sacrifice performance
- Anyone looking to maximize fun on small days without feeling limited as the waves improve

**Pros:**

- Excellent paddling and wave-catching ability
- Fast and lively in small surf
- Versatile enough for a range of conditions
- High-quality construction

**Cons:**

- Not a true groveler for the absolute smallest days
- May feel too wide for surfers who prefer narrow, high-performance shortboards

**Summary**

The Pyzel Gremlin is a standout choice for surfers who want one board that can handle the majority of their sessions. For more, see [StabMag's review](https://stabmag.com/gear/pyzel-gremlin-review/).

    excerpt: "A look at why the Firewire Sci-Fi 2.0 is a favorite for progressive surfers seeking speed, versatility, and innovation.",
    content: `The Firewire Sci-Fi 2.0, designed by Daniel "Tomo" Thomson in collaboration with Kelly Slater, is frequently praised for its futuristic outline and advanced construction. The board uses Firewireâ€™s Helium construction, combining lightweight EPS foam with parabolic carbon rails for a lively, responsive feel ([Surfd](https://surfd.com/2020/01/firewire-sci-fi-2-0-review/)).

**Performance**

- Small Waves (2-4 feet): The Sci-Fi 2.0 paddles easily and catches waves early thanks to its generous width and flat rocker. The board feels fast right off the takeoff, generating speed even in weaker surf. The wide tail and quad setup make it easy to skate through flat sections and maintain momentum.
- Medium Waves (4-6 feet): As the surf picks up, the Sci-Fi 2.0 really comes alive. The boardâ€™s unique bottom contours provide excellent hold and drive down the line, while the sharp rails allow for crisp, controlled turns. The thruster setup adds extra bite and control, making it a great choice for steeper faces and more powerful conditions.
- Larger Waves (6+ feet): While not a dedicated step-up, the Sci-Fi 2.0 holds its own in overhead surf. The board remains stable at speed and handles late drops with confidence. Advanced surfers will appreciate its ability to transition from rail to rail and maintain control in critical sections.

**Who Should Ride It**

- Intermediate to advanced surfers looking for a high-performance shortboard with a modern twist
- Surfers who want one board that works in a wide range of conditions
- Fans of Tomoâ€™s innovative designs and Firewireâ€™s Helium construction
- Anyone seeking speed, maneuverability, and versatility in their quiver

**Pros:**

- Fast and lively in all conditions
- Versatile five-fin setup
- Lightweight, durable Helium construction
- Excellent paddling and wave-catching ability
- Modern design encourages progressive surfing

**Cons:**

- Unconventional outline may not appeal to traditionalists
- Wide tail can feel skatey in very steep waves
- Premium price point

**Summary**

The Firewire Sci-Fi 2.0 is a standout for surfers who want to blend futuristic design with real-world performance. For more, see [Surfd's review](https://surfd.com/2020/01/firewire-sci-fi-2-0-review/).

    excerpt: "A look at why the Line Tom Wallisch Pro is a favorite for park and urban skiers who still want all-mountain versatility.",
    content: `The 2025 Tom Wallisch Pro from Line is consistently praised in ski reviews for its modern freestyle performance and all-mountain versatility. The ski features a symmetric shape, Carbon Ollieband construction, and a medium flex that balances playfulness and stability ([BlisterReview](https://blisterreview.com/gear-reviews/2025-line-tom-wallisch-pro)).

**Performance**

- Park: The TW Pro excels on rails and jumps, with a flex pattern that feels balanced for presses without folding on landings. The 90mm waist is stable on takeoffs while staying quick edge to edge.
- All-Mountain: While it's a true park ski, the TW Pro holds its own on groomers and in light powder. The sidecut makes carving predictable and the swing weight is low enough for quick spins off side hits.

**Pros:**

- Playful yet stable flex
- Durable construction for park abuse
- Versatile enough for cruising the whole mountain

**Cons:**

- 90mm waist sinks in deep powder
- Not ideal for big-mountain charging

**Summary**

Freestyle skiers who spend most of their time in the park or sessioning urban features will appreciate the Tom Wallisch Pro. For more, see [BlisterReview's review](https://blisterreview.com/gear-reviews/2025-line-tom-wallisch-pro).
