    title: "Never Summer Proto Type Two Review: The All-Mountain Beast That Lives Up to the Hype",
    excerpt: "After riding the Never Summer Proto Type Two for a full season, we break down why this board has become a favorite among advanced riders and what makes it stand out in the crowded all-mountain category.",
    content: `The Never Summer Proto Type Two has been making waves in the snowboarding community, and after putting it through its paces across varied terrain and conditions, it's clear why this board has earned such a devoted following.

**Build Quality and Construction**

Never Summer's proprietary Rocker Camber construction is immediately noticeable. The board features camber underfoot with rocker at the tip and tail, creating a lively, responsive feel that excels in both carving and powder. The carbon fiber VXR laminate adds snap without making the board overly stiff.

The sintered base is fast and holds wax well, while the Durasurf XT topsheet has proven incredibly durable through a season of abuse. At 159cm, the board feels substantial but not heavy, with excellent torsional stiffness.

**On-Mountain Performance**

**Groomed Runs**

The Proto Type Two absolutely shines on groomed terrain. The camber underfoot provides excellent edge hold, even on icy East Coast conditions. Turn initiation is quick and precise, with minimal chatter at speed.

**Powder**

The rockered nose floats effortlessly in deep snow, while the setback stance and tapered tail help the board surf through powder with minimal effort. It's not quite as playful as a dedicated powder board, but for an all-mountain stick, it performs admirably.

**Park and Freestyle**

While not primarily designed for park riding, the Proto Type Two holds its own on jumps and rails. The medium flex provides enough pop for ollies while maintaining stability on landings.

**The Verdict**

**Pros:**

- Exceptional edge hold and carving performance
- Versatile across all terrain types
- Durable construction that withstands heavy use
- Great float in powder for an all-mountain board
- Responsive and lively feel

**Cons:**

- Higher price point than many competitors
- May be too aggressive for beginner/intermediate riders
- Limited availability (sells out quickly each season)

**Rating: 9/10**

The Never Summer Proto Type Two delivers on its promise as a high-performance all-mountain board. While the price tag might give some pause, the quality construction and versatile performance make it worth the investment for advanced riders seeking one board that can handle everything the mountain throws at them.

If you're an experienced rider looking for a daily driver that excels in carving, handles powder well, and will last for years, the Proto Type Two should be at the top of your list.

    title: "Firewire Seaside Surfboard Review: Rob Machado's Small Wave Magic",
    excerpt: "The Firewire Seaside has revolutionized small wave surfing. Our comprehensive review covers everything from construction to performance in the waves that most of us surf every day.",
    content: `Rob Machado's collaboration with Firewire has produced some truly innovative boards, but the Seaside might be his masterpiece. After months of testing in everything from knee-high slop to overhead waves, here's our complete breakdown.

**Design Philosophy and Construction**

The Seaside represents a fresh approach to small wave surfing. Machado drew inspiration from vintage single fins and modern shortboard performance, creating something entirely unique. The board features a distinctive outline with a wide nose, parallel rails through the middle, and a dramatic hip in the tail.

Firewire's Helium construction keeps the board light while maintaining durability. The EPS foam core with carbon fiber rails provides excellent paddle power and responsiveness without feeling overly stiff.

**Dimensions and Setup**

We tested the 5'5" x 20.5" x 2.5" (35.5L) model, which proved perfect for surfers in the 160-180 lb range. The generous volume is immediately apparent when paddling - this board catches waves effortlessly.

The board comes as a quad setup, but we found it works equally well as a twin fin or even a single fin for that classic feel.

**Wave Performance**

**Small Waves (1-3 feet)**

This is where the Seaside truly shines. The wide nose and high volume make wave catching incredibly easy, while the pulled-in tail allows for surprisingly tight turns. The board generates speed from nothing and maintains momentum through flat sections.

**Medium Waves (3-5 feet)**

Still excellent performance, though the board's small wave DNA is apparent. It's playful and fun, encouraging a more flowing surf style rather than aggressive carving.

**Larger Waves (5+ feet)**

While certainly rideable, the Seaside feels out of its element in powerful surf. The wide nose can catch rail, and the board lacks the drive needed for critical sections.

**Who Should Ride It**

The Seaside is perfect for:

- Intermediate to advanced surfers looking for small wave fun
- Anyone frustrated with traditional shortboards in weak surf
- Surfers wanting to develop a more flow-based style
- Beach break specialists dealing with inconsistent waves

**The Verdict**

**Pros:**

- Incredible wave-catching ability
- Fun and playful in small surf
- Quality Firewire construction
- Versatile fin setup options
- Encourages creative surfing

**Cons:**

- Limited performance in larger waves
- Wide nose takes getting used to
- Premium price point
- Not suitable for aggressive, performance-oriented surfing

**Rating: 8.5/10**

The Firewire Seaside delivers exactly what it promises - pure fun in small waves. While it's not an everyday board for all conditions, it excels so dramatically in its intended environment that it's worth having in any serious surfer's quiver.

If you find yourself struggling to have fun in typical beach break surf or want to rediscover the joy of surfing in less-than-perfect conditions, the Seaside might just change your perspective on what makes a good surf session.
